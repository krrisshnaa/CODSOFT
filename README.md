# CODSOFT Internship Projects

This repository contains all the tasks and projects I developed during my internship at **CODSOFT**.  
The projects showcase my skills in Python programming, GUI development using **Tkinter**, and problem-solving abilities.  
All tasks (except the Calculator) are built with a **Tkinter-based graphical user interface** for an interactive user experience.
